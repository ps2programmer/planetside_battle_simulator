# Planetside Battle Simulator

A very basic program that aims to simulate planetside battle flow at the base-level. The main goal of this is learning and fun, however, if useful or interesting insights into how battle flow progresses can be learned then that's a bonus. 

Currently, it's built using Python's Pygame library. This was chosen because I'm already familiar with Pygame and I don't know how much time I'd commit to this project so it's meant to serve as a prototype of a potential simulation in a better engine like Unity (which I'm still in the process of learning). 

# How To Run

1. Fork the repository
2. Download the latest version of Python if you don't have it already
3. Install Pygame using the command "pip install pygame" in your terminal
4. Run battle_simulator.py
